This author of this article makes an interesting analogy between software engineering and tennis. They mention that if you are playing a losing game in tennis, then a winning strategy is simply mitigating your mistakes and letting the opponent make mistakes. In software engineering, we often make mistakes. A lot of them. In this way, the author compares software engineering and tennis by saying that we are constantly playing a losing game. The author then starts a discussion as to how we can win a losing game in software engineering.

Personally, I am the type of person who wants to avoid mistakes at all costs because I hate dealing with them. And I think a lot of other people are like that too. But from my past experience, I found that I learn the most whenever I make a mistake and fix it. So rather then trying to avoid mistakes, I should be embracing them instead.

## Comment
Darren Le: I think the article offers an interesting perspective on the nature of software engineering as a discipline. Engineers are often operating at a disadvantage and will have to tackle many problems that are often unsolvable within business constraints. The mindset of "embracing your mistakes" is perhaps a more realistic view of software engineering as an everyday job than the often perfectionist goals we have in school.
